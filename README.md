> [!NOTE]
> I've noticed some weird doods are following me trying to promote/advertise something (i.e. "I can do X for you/your business"), having an *uncannily large number of following users* (usually tens of thousands or more) and/or bearing other strange indications in their profile. If you do too, just nevermind. I don't know any of them. *This could be a common phenomenon in social media, who knows*. The others in the list are either my friends or someone passing by.

# HAI
## basic info ig
18 yo (as of some point mid 2025), born in 1179131700th second after unix epoch, he/him/any, a native Vietnamese, your talking bush (lel), who likes tech. sometimes be funny and be funky.
nothing special in the GitHub profile so uh...

I use both Windows/Linux but currently Door. next OS gonna be System V ported on a triune brain processor.

Knows a molecule of Python.
Also knows Windows Batch in basic. I aim to learn Bash later too. Pretty much a newb. Won't accept any offers for now. Mark my words. üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è (at least til im good with my major on uni)

## do
occasionally translating stuff. I recently submitted a (kinda) complete vi translation to an emulation project not gonnuh mention here. Yes I meant you can just understand at least English and your local speak (if any). Might be a boring, wasting time, if you think so, but nvm am enjoying it rn so uhhh

translating new valve game as a community localisation project. taking ages since im lazy lmao (edit: yeah actually altho as a part time job, i am still dedicating many of my free times just to do this and surfing the net ngl its a boredom) (edit2: the project is now temporarily halted due to lessening interest in it)

has some html/css literation. I made a website, as well as a simple css file out of some css sample codes from the internet and what i've learned from my it lesson and made it a bit monospaced paranoid-ish looking. just a silly test tho, but you can find it in my [github.io repo](https://github.com/barnacl437/barnacl437.github.io). enjoy!!!1!1!111!111!11!1!!! reckon gotta learn js later 

## unpopular opinion
vi/vim/nvim are all good lock screens.   

## babel
just a wikipedia-copypasted language proficiency showcase.

```wikitext
{{#babel:vi-N|en-3|eo-0|zh-0|tok-1}}
```


## licence usage
I mostly use [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) or no licence on my projects. They are mostly for fun perhaps, so the licence should be also fun and short af xddd

## a bit of trifle drills...
and hey, I am generally friendly, talkative, a little smart-ass seeming but still reachable ~~(yes i am smartass)~~. I accept open friend requests and open dm (albeit with some conditions), so feel free to talk to me on my "supported" social platforms, a complete list is available [here](https://barnacl437.github.io/#social-links). Can't properly send a fen req on discord? want to leave some relics proving your existence somewhere on the internet? Throw me your word @ this repo's [discussion page](https://github.com/Barnacl437/Barnacl437/discussions). I treat it as a forum gateway and would hope to reading allat anything you write as i have time to do. lel

### KTHXBYE!!11!!111!1!
